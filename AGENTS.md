## What Switchback is

A **local-first AI execution gateway**: one Rust binary that receives every AI call (OpenAI/Anthropic-compatible HTTP), normalizes it into a **canonical typed IR**, routes it across providers / accounts / runtimes with an **explainable decision** and **fallback**, and streams the response back in the client's format. Built so it can grow team → hosted → OpenRouter-class **without a rewrite** — by hardening seams, not piling on providers.

## Golden rules (invariants — do not break these)

1. **The core never sees provider wire formats.** `sb-core` types (`AiRequest`, `AiStreamEvent`, …) are provider-agnostic. All OpenAI/Anthropic/etc. JSON lives in `sb-protocols` and adapters, translated at the edges. If you find yourself putting `"choices"` or `"chat.completion"` in `sb-core`, stop.
2. **Every request produces an explainable `RouteDecision`** (selected target, reason[], fallbacks[], rejected[] with reasons). Routing is never an opaque black box.
3. **Secrets are leases and are never logged.** Use `Secret`/`CredentialLease`; they redact in `Debug`. Logs are **metadata-only by default** (request id, model, provider, latency, tokens, error class, route reason — never prompt/response/keys).
4. **Streaming-first, one path.** Adapters always emit a normalized `Stream<AiStreamEvent>`. Non-streaming responses are produced by *collecting* that stream. Do not write a second non-streaming code path. One SSE decoder + one encoder per wire format — never three.
5. **Deterministic before clever.** v1 routing is hard-filters → ordered candidates → fallback. No ML/semantic routing in the hot path.
6. **Don't widen the provider surface faster than you harden the seams.** A new adapter is cheap only because the trait/IR are clean. Keep them clean first.

## Architecture & crate map

Acyclic crate graph (`sb-core` is the root everything depends on):

```
sb-core        canonical typed IR + config types + error taxonomy. NO deps on other sb crates.
   ├── sb-adapter      ProviderAdapter trait + AdapterError + shared HTTP/SSE helpers
   ├── sb-protocols    OpenAI <-> canonical (ingress, egress, upstream) + SSE encode/decode  ← the hub
   ├── sb-router       hard filters, candidate ordering (TARGET selection), RouteDecision
   ├── sb-credentials  multi-account auth: account selection (fill_first/round_robin) +
   │                   per-(account,model) availability locks + redacting leases + age vault
   ├── sb-compress     RTK-style fail-safe tool-result compression (never-empty/never-grow)
   └── sb-ledger       append-only usage/cost ledger (priced from the catalog; the marketplace seam)
            └── sb-adapters   mock + ComposedAdapter(WireCodec × AuthScheme): openai/anthropic/gemini/vertex codecs (dep: adapter, protocols, core)
                     └── sb-runtime  the execution runtime: immutable revisioned CompiledSnapshot
                     │               (config+registry+resolver+knobs behind arc_swap) + the Engine that owns
                     │               the TARGET×ACCOUNT attempt state machine (route → resolve → retry →
                     │               two-level fallback → hedge → budget → trace). HTTP-agnostic.
                     │               (dep: sb-store — durable revision/audit history)
   sb-store      StateStore trait + bundled-SQLite backend: config revisions + audit + durable usage
                 + coordination leases for admission/idempotency/tenant concurrency
                 (no sb deps; also a sb-ledger dep — the usage sink)
   sb-plugin     Plugin trait + trusted trait-object built-ins (Oracle #6 tier 1); a sb-runtime dep
                     └── sb-server   Axum app + handlers + SSE + clap CLI; HTTP ingress/egress + protocol
                                     translation over `Engine::execute` → binary `switchback`
```

**The runtime boundary (Oracle critique #1):** `sb-runtime::Engine::execute(req) -> (revision,
ExecOutcome)` owns request execution; `sb-server` is reduced to translating the client's wire
format in/out and rendering the `ExecOutcome`. Each request pins ONE `Snapshot` for its lifetime
(a config publish never tears a request across revisions); the ledger + trace sinks live on the
Engine and survive hot-reloads. The runtime does NOT depend on axum — failures flow as a
wire-agnostic `ExecError`. The principle: *one binary can stay; one topology cannot* — the same
crate supports a future separate data-plane binary without rewriting execution.

**The credential boundary (separation of concerns — do not blur it):** `sb-router`
picks the *target* (provider/model); `sb-credentials` picks the *account* + secret and
tracks availability; `sb-adapters` *executes* with the lease it's handed; `sb-server` is
the only place the two are joined. Adapters must contain NO account-selection logic; the
router must contain NO credential logic.

Request lifecycle (the hot path):

```
HTTP in → sb-protocols (ingress: client JSON → AiRequest)
        → sb-router      (filter → order → RouteDecision; picks the TARGET provider/model)
        → sb-credentials (resolve(provider, model) → ACCOUNT + lease; skips locked accounts)
        → sb-adapters    (canonical → upstream wire, execute with lease, upstream stream → AiStreamEvent)
        → sb-protocols   (egress: AiStreamEvent → client SSE / collected JSON)
        → HTTP out       (+ metadata-only log, + x-switchback-route header)
   Fallback is TWO-LEVEL: account-level (rotate accounts within a provider, locking failed
   ones per-(account,model)) then target-level (across providers). Fallback is only legal
   BEFORE the first streamed byte.
```

## How to add a provider

Every real provider is `ComposedAdapter(Codec × Signer × Transport)` — you almost never write a new `ProviderAdapter` (only `mock` is bespoke). The three seams (`sb-adapters/src/{codec,signer,transport}.rs`) are independent: pick a codec for the wire, a signer for auth, a transport for framing.

- **Reuses an existing wire format** (OpenAI-shaped / Anthropic / Gemini)? It's **config**: a `providers:` entry with the right `type:` (and `auth_scheme:` if non-bearer). Zero code. The registry uses `ComposedAdapter::with_scheme` (= `SchemeSigner` + `HttpTransport`).
- **A new wire format?** Implement `WireCodec` in `codec.rs` (`url`, `request_body`, `parse_response`, `decoder`, optional `headers`/`embeddings_url`), delegating to a `sb-protocols::<format>` module. The execute loop, auth, streaming, and fallback are inherited.
- **A new auth method that signs the built request** (SigV4, …)? Implement `RequestSigner` in `signer.rs` (it sees a `SignTarget`: method/host/path/body). Bearer/header/query auth already exists as `SchemeSigner`. (Bedrock = `BedrockCodec × SigV4Signer × EventStreamTransport`; Vertex = gemini codec × Bearer + a service-account JWT minter.)
- **A new wire framing** (binary event-stream, websocket, …)? Implement `Transport` + `Framer` in `transport.rs` (framing only — the codec's `decoder` still owns semantics). `HttpTransport` (text SSE) + `EventStreamTransport` (AWS binary) exist.
- A change to streaming/tool-calls requires a streamed-fixture test (in the codec's `sb-protocols` module).

## How to add a wire protocol (e.g. Anthropic ingress)

1. New module `sb-protocols/src/<format>.rs` with `request_from_<format>`, `to_<format>_response`, `<format>_sse_event`, and (if it's also an upstream) `canonical_to_<format>_body` + `parse_<format>_stream`.
2. New ingress route in `sb-server`. New `FORMATS` entry. Keep OpenAI canonical as the hub — translate `format ↔ canonical`, never `format ↔ other_format` directly.

## Conventions

- **Errors:** `thiserror` enums per crate; map to the shared `ErrorClass` at the adapter boundary. No `unwrap()`/`expect()` in the hot path; no silent `let _ = ...` swallowing of errors that matter (9router's `.catch(()=>{})` is the anti-pattern).
- **Async:** Tokio. Adapters return `BoxStream<'static, Result<AiStreamEvent, AdapterError>>`.
- **Serde:** `#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]` on config; explicit field mapping for wire formats.
- **Tests:** unit tests next to code; protocol fixtures under `tests/fixtures/`. A change to streaming/tool-calls requires a test.
- **Commits:** conventional (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `docs:`). Small, focused.
- **No new crate** without a reason that maps to a real seam.

## v1 scope (do not exceed without asking)

In: OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/responses`, `/v1/embeddings`, `/v1/models`, `/v1/usage`, `/health`, plus Anthropic ingress `/v1/messages` (+ `/v1/messages/count_tokens`) — stream+non-stream throughout, rendered back in the client's own wire format; mock + openai_compatible + anthropic + gemini adapters (three distinct upstream wire formats through one hub); multi-account YAML config; **capability-filtered, explainable routing** (hard-filters on streaming/tools/json-schema/context, sourced from realistic per-api-kind defaults + the catalog's per-model facts — so the filter is real, not a no-op) + two-level (target × account) fallback; metadata-only logs; **encrypted credential vault** (age-encrypted file + OS-keychain key, `vault` CLI, `auth.vault` source — §13.4 "day-one" gap closed); **RTK-style tool-result compression** (`sb-compress`, opt-in `compress_tool_results`, fail-safe never-grow/never-empty + catch_unwind passthrough); **typed data-model seams** (`sb-core::catalog` — distinct provider/model/account/credential/price entities with tenant scope, FK-by-id, referential-integrity `validate()`, and a price ledger with history; §13.3, surfaced by `doctor`); **Gemini adapter** (`sb-protocols::gemini` + `sb-adapters::gemini` — GenerateContent, `x-goog-api-key`, model-in-URL, tool-result-by-name correlation since Gemini has no tool-call ids); **capability negotiation** (catalog `Model.capability_profile()` + `ApiKind::default_capabilities()` feed the router; `RouteRequire.json_schema` + request-inferred structured-output requirement); **JSON-Schema downleveler** (`sb-protocols::schema` — `downlevel(schema, &SchemaCaps)`: anyOf→best-branch, const→string-enum, type-arrays→first, $ref/additionalProperties stripped, empty-object→placeholder; capability-driven, applied to Gemini tool schemas so complex tools work instead of 400-ing; audit §9.8); **usage/cost ledger** (`sb-ledger` — append-only, in-memory + optional JSONL sink + optional durable SQLite sink (`sb-store`); when a store is attached, `/v1/usage` and budget checks read its live rollup, and `state_store.required: true` makes pre-response usage persistence fail closed; streaming usage is recorded at stream finish and can only log a post-commit store failure; per-request usage priced from the catalog ledger in integer micro-USD; `GET /v1/usage` summary + `server.usage_log` sink); **AuthScheme seam** (`sb-core::AuthScheme` — bearer/header/query composed from config, now applied by `sb-adapters::SchemeSigner`; the request-signing case is `SigV4Signer` (Oracle #5); audit §9.6). Adding an OpenAI-shaped provider (OpenRouter/Groq/Mistral/Together/DeepSeek/NIM/vLLM…) is now pure config — `type: openai_compatible` + base_url; one that authenticates with a non-bearer header is *also* pure config (`auth_scheme: { kind: header, name: x-api-key }`); **WireCodec collapse** (every real provider rides one `ComposedAdapter` execute loop — thin codecs; only `mock` is bespoke); **Vertex** (`VertexCodec` = Gemini wire on GCP's project URL + Bearer token — a new cloud provider as a codec + auth, no new adapter); **Gemini structured output** (`response_format` → `responseSchema` via the downleveler); **Vertex service-account JWT auto-refresh** (`ServiceAccountMinter` mints/refreshes a token from a GCP key); **AWS Bedrock** (SigV4 request-signing via `sb-adapters::sigv4` + binary `event-stream` framing via `sb-adapters::event_stream`, reusing the Anthropic wire — originally a dedicated adapter, now expressed on the composed path as `ComposedAdapter(BedrockCodec × SigV4Signer × EventStreamTransport)`; see the Oracle #5 note below). Resilience: **same-target retry**, a **provider circuit breaker** (`sb-credentials::breaker`), **spend-cap budgets** (global + per-provider), and **request hedging**. Control plane: a **live runtime overlay** (`PATCH /v1/runtime`) + redacted config API + dashboard + `config` CLI. **Execution runtime** (`sb-runtime` — Oracle #1): the TARGET×ACCOUNT attempt state machine extracted out of the HTTP edge into `Engine::execute`, over an immutable revisioned `CompiledSnapshot` hot-swapped atomically (per-request snapshot pinning; `POST /v1/reload`; `x-switchback-revision` header). **Durable state** (`sb-store` — Oracle #2): a `StateStore` trait + bundled-SQLite backend persisting revision/audit/usage metadata, global admission slots, idempotency in-flight claims, and tenant concurrency slots, opt-in via `server.state_store`; active coordination leases renew while the request/stream guard is alive, and TTLs clean up abandoned rows after process failure. Durable drafts can persist proposed config bodies, and idempotency can persist response bodies only when explicitly enabled. Surfaced at `GET /v1/revisions`, `/v1/audit`, `/v1/usage/events`. **Idempotency** (`sb-server::idempotency` — Oracle #2/#7): `Idempotency-Key` gives single-flight (concurrent duplicate → 409, streams included via a drop-guard held for the stream's life); when `server.state_store` is configured, in-flight claims coordinate across gateway processes sharing that store and renew while active. Reused key + different body → 422. Durable full replay of non-streaming responses requires both `server.state_store` and `server.idempotency.persist_response_bodies: true`; streams are not stored for replay. **Adapter seam** (`sb-adapters::{codec,signer,transport}` — Oracle #5): the `ComposedAdapter` execute loop is now `Codec × Signer × Transport` — codec=wire translation, signer=auth (`SchemeSigner` bearer/header/query, or `SigV4Signer` over the built request), transport=framing (`HttpTransport` text-SSE / `EventStreamTransport` AWS binary). `with_scheme` keeps simple providers a one-liner; Bedrock rides the same loop. The old `apply_auth` + bespoke Bedrock adapter are gone. **Admission control** (`sb-server::admission` — Oracle #8): a global `server.max_concurrency` cap queues bursts (bounded `admission_timeout_ms` wait, `x-switchback-queue-ms` header) and sheds with 503 past the timeout; with `server.state_store`, admission slots coordinate across gateway processes sharing that store and renew while active; the permit is held through the response/stream. `server.max_response_bytes` caps the non-streaming collect path (`collect_response` aborts → 502). Surfaced at `GET /v1/health` (`admission`). Composes with #4's per-tenant concurrency (global = gateway protection, per-tenant = fairness). **Plugins** (`sb-plugin` — Oracle #6, tier 1): trusted trait-object built-ins compiled into the snapshot from `config.plugins` and run on the hot path — hooks `pre_route` (inspect/modify/reject → 403), `post_route` (observe decision), `select_egress` (override the egress path), `post_attempt` (observe outcome). Built-ins: `model_blocklist`, `request_tag`, `egress_pin`. Surfaced at `GET /v1/plugins`. **Tier 2** (sandboxed Wasm via Wasmtime, same `Plugin` trait) is built behind the OFF-by-default `wasm` feature (`cargo build -p sb-server --features wasm`): a `type: wasm` plugin runs a `.wasm`/`.wat` guest exporting `memory` + `alloc` + `pre_route(ptr,len)->i32` (0=allow / status=reject) over the model bytes; feature-off or load-failure = a loud no-op (fail-open). Default builds pull no wasmtime. Tier 3 (dynamic libs) stays an internal escape hatch. **Declarative control plane** (`sb-server::cp` — the Oracle control-plane surface): `/cp/v1` exposes the config as k8s-style envelopes (`apiVersion`/`kind`/`metadata{name,revision,etag}`/`spec`) for ProviderEndpoint/RouteProfile/Tenant/EgressProfile/Plugin (`GET /cp/v1/resources/{kind}`+`/{name}`, redacted), a draft→validate→publish lifecycle (`POST /cp/v1/drafts`, `/{id}/validate`, `/{id}/publish` — atomic hot-swap via `Engine::reload`, `If-Match` optimistic concurrency → 409), `POST /cp/v1/route-preview` (the `RouteDecision` without executing, via `Engine::preview_route`), `POST /cp/v1/admission-preview` (would-this-be-admitted: global headroom + tenant concurrency/budget), and `GET /cp/v1/watch` (SSE stream of revision changes). The API is authoritative; YAML stays bootstrap. **Tails done:** unknown-model passthrough flagged `unverified` in the `RouteDecision` (#5); `client_aborted` trace (status 499) when a client hangs up mid-stream, via a `FinishGuard` on the metered stream (#8); `POST /cp/v1/admission-preview` + `GET /cp/v1/watch` (SSE); `server.privacy_mode` knob (metadata_only default — the only enforced mode); **durable drafts** (the `/cp/v1` draft store persists to SQLite when `state_store` is set — full config bodies incl. secrets); **tier-2 Wasm** (above). Deferred: OTel HTTP semantic-convention export (otel feature), resource PUT/PATCH/DELETE, richer Wasm hooks/WIT. **Hardening (external audit pass):** a `require_auth` middleware gates EVERY endpoint except `/` + `/health` — when `api_key`/`api_keys` is configured all `/v1/*` and `/cp/v1/*` (config, providers, traces, usage, control plane) require it, not just inference (open by default when unset); egress identity REFUSES auth-bearing headers and is applied before auth so the lease always wins; `Secret` is no longer `Serialize`/`Deserialize` (can't cross a serialization boundary); routing + ledger price from ONE function (`AdapterRegistry::cost_micros`: cost_map index → catalog fallback) so route and billed cost can't diverge; **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml` — fmt/clippy-`-D warnings`/test/release + a wasm/otel feature job + advisory `cargo audit`). Still open from the audit: operator-defined network allowlists, persistence of rotated OAuth refresh tokens for env/inline sources, richer hosted StateStore backends/ops, fine-grained resource permissions, billing marketplace/reconciliation, multimodal IR, and explicit fallback-commit state-machine docs.

 **Health-aware routing** (Oracle #3): `sb-credentials::pool_health` exposes a NON-secret account-pool view (usable-account count + circuit state) that `sb-runtime` stamps onto each candidate (`ExecutionTarget.healthy_accounts`); the router DEMOTES targets with no healthy accounts below executable ones (stable, named in the decision, never hard-rejects so a last resort survives) — surfaced at `GET /v1/health`. **TTFT/throughput split**: `LatencyTracker` keeps a second EWMA for time-to-first-token (streamed responses only); latency-aware routing ranks interactive (streaming) requests on TTFT, others on total latency.

 **Multi-tenancy + quotas** (Oracle #4): `tenants:` + `api_keys:` config — an API key resolves to a `Principal` (tenant + project) at the edge (`sb-server::tenancy`); usage is attributed per tenant (`AiRequest.tenant`, `UsageRecord/UsageEvent.tenant`, `LedgerSummary.by_tenant`). Hard limits reject BEFORE upstream dispatch: per-tenant `budget_usd` → 402 (`sb-runtime`, read from the live durable rollup when `state_store` is configured), `max_concurrency` → 429 (durable tenant slots with `state_store`, renewed while active; otherwise in-memory reserve-then-reconcile guard held through the response/stream). Surfaced at `GET /v1/tenants` + `/v1/usage` `by_tenant`. (Account provenance / resale gating is intentionally NOT built.)

Out (seams only, not implementations): billing/marketplace/reconciliation, fine-grained resource scopes, full dashboard UI, MCP/A2A, learned/semantic routing. **Persistence:** the control-plane revision/audit store + durable usage + optional idempotency replay + renewed, owner-scoped cross-node admission/tenant-concurrency/idempotency in-flight coordination now exist (`sb-store`, SQLite); still out: DB-backed *live* config (YAML stays the bootstrap source of truth), hosted-grade StateStore backend/ops, and raw prompt/response storage by default.
